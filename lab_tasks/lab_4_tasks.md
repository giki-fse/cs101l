## 1. **Using a do while loop** write a program that simulates a password check. The user must enter the correct password, and the program will keep prompting until the correct password is entered.

``` cpp
do{
    // this block executes first time regradless of the condition=
} while(condition);
```
### Output

```

Enter the password:
wrong pass
Please try again.
Enter the password: 
another wrong pass
Please try again.
Enter the password: 
mySecret123
Access granted!
```


## 2. **Using continue in a Loop** write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20, but skips numbers divisible by 3. Use the continue statement to skip the unwanted numbers.

### Output
```

1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 19 20

```

## **Using while loop** write a program that prints a number pyramid based on the number of rows provided by the user.

### Output for 5 rows:

```

        1
      1 2 1
    1 2 3 2 1
  1 2 3 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
```
