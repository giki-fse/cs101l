# Lab 3 Tasks

## 1. Create a Simple Calculator Using Switch Cases

### Objective

Write a C++ program that functions as a simple calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

### Instructions

1. Prompt the user to input two numbers. 
2. Ask the user to choose an operation: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division. 
3. Use a switch statement to perform the selected operation based on the user's choice. 
4. Display the result of the operation. 
5. Handle invalid operation input by displaying an error message.

**Use a switch case to perform operations based on user choice and handle default cases for invalid inputs.**

## 2. Check Eligibility for Voting Based on Age and CNIC Using Nested If-Else

### Objective

Write a C++ program that checks whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age and CNIC (National Identity Card) status.

### Instructions

1. Prompt the user to enter their age. 
2. Ask the user if they have a valid CNIC (Y for Yes, N for No). 
3. Use nested if-else statements to determine eligibility: 
4. A person is eligible to vote if they are 18 years or older and have a valid CNIC. 
5. If the person is under 18, they are not eligible. 
6. If the person does not have a CNIC, they are not eligible regardless of age. 
7. Display the eligibility status.

**Use nested if-else statements to check both conditions (age and CNIC status).**

## 3. Determine If a Number is Odd or Even Using Ternary Operator

### Objective

Write a C++ program that determines whether a given number is odd or even.

### Instructions

1. Prompt the user to input an integer number. 
2. Use an if-else statement to determine if the number is odd or even. 
    - A number is even if it is divisible by 2 (number % 2 == 0). 
    - Otherwise, the number is odd. 
3. Display the result.
